# atlas upload

The `upload` command is the core of the Atlas CLI. It uploads flight data and automatically generates Ghost Flight Reports.

```bash
atlas upload <file.bin> [files...] --tailnum <number> [options]
```

---

## Arguments

<ParamField path="file.bin" type="string" required>
  Path to a `.bin` file containing flight telemetry. You can specify multiple bin files for parallel processing.
</ParamField>

---

## Required Flags

<ParamField path="--tailnum" type="string" required>
  Tail number of the aircraft. Used to link the report to your fleet asset.
  
  ```bash
  atlas upload flight.bin --tailnum 436
  ```
</ParamField>

---

## Optional Flags

<ParamField path="-l, --log-file" type="string">
  Add a log file for analysis. Can be repeated for multiple logs.
  
  ```bash
  atlas upload flight.bin -l heliod.log -l can.log --tailnum 436
  ```
  
  <Note>
    Log files enable deeper software and CAN bus analysis. The more context you provide, the better the insights.
  </Note>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--system" type="string" default="ghost">
  System/product type for the asset. Defaults to `ghost`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--url" type="string">
  Override the Atlas API URL. Takes precedence over `ATLAS_URL` env var and `~/.atlas/url` config.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--token" type="string">
  Override the authentication token. Takes precedence over `ATLAS_TOKEN` env var and `~/.atlas/token`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-k, --insecure" type="boolean" default="false">
  Skip TLS certificate verification. Use for local development only.
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Basic Upload

Upload a single bin file:

```bash
atlas upload flight.bin --tailnum 436
```

### With Log Files

Upload with additional log analysis:

```bash
atlas upload flight.bin -l software.log -l can.log --tailnum 436
```

### Multiple Flights (Parallel)

Upload multiple bin files simultaneously:

```bash
atlas upload flight1.bin flight2.bin flight3.bin --tailnum 436
```

All flights process in parallel with real-time status:

```
  ⬡ Parallel Upload
    Processing 3 flights simultaneously

  ◐ Checking asset...
  ✓ Asset found

  ✓ flight3.bin (2m 15s) → https://atlas.../issue/abc...
  ✓ flight1.bin (2m 45s) → https://atlas.../issue/def...
  ✓ flight2.bin (3m 01s) → https://atlas.../issue/ghi...

## What Happens During Upload

<Steps>
  <Step title="Asset Resolution">
    Finds or creates a fleet asset for the tail number
  </Step>
  <Step title="Session Creation">
    Creates a new Atlas session for the upload
  </Step>
  <Step title="File Upload">
    Uploads bin file and any log files
  </Step>
  <Step title="Job Creation">
    Creates a GFR generation job
  </Step>
  <Step title="Processing">
    Monitors job progress with live status updates
  </Step>
  <Step title="Linking">
    Links the generated report to your fleet asset
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Processing Phases

The CLI shows real-time progress through these phases:

| Phase | Description | Typical Duration |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Parsing binary data | Extracting raw telemetry | ~30s |
| Extracting telemetry | Converting to structured data | ~60s |
| Analyzing flight parameters | AI analysis of patterns | ~90s |
| Running log analysis | Software/CAN analysis (if logs provided) | ~120s |
| Correlating logs | Matching logs to telemetry events | ~60s |
| Finalizing report | Generating final GFR | ~30s |

<Info>
  Total processing time depends on file size and whether log files are included. Typical range: 2-8 minutes.
