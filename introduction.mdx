## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- A terminal or command prompt open
- An **Atlas account** (contact Arya Hezarkhini from Arena in **#sp-arena-ghost** to get set up)

<Note>
  This guide covers the terminal CLI. Atlas is also available on the **[web](https://ghost.anduril.gov.arena-ai.com)** for uploading files and viewing reports.
</Note>

---

## Step 1: Install Atlas CLI

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL http://ghost.anduril.gov.arena-ai.com/api/v1/cli/install.sh | bash
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bashrc
```

---

## Step 2: Authenticate

Link your Atlas account to the CLI:

```bash
atlas login
```

This opens a browser window to complete authentication. Once finished, your token is saved locally.

## Generating Ghost Flight Reports

Upload a `.bin` file and Atlas automatically generates a **Ghost Flight Report (GFR)** - an AI-powered analysis that identifies anomalies, analyzes flight parameters, and provides actionable insights about what happened during the flight.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single flight">
    ```bash
    atlas upload flight.bin --tailnum 4308
    ```
    
    The `--tailnum` is required to identify the asset when uploading flight data.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Multiple flights">
    ```bash
    atlas upload flight1.bin flight2.bin flight3.bin --tailnum 4308
    ```
    
    Multiple bin files are processed in parallel. All reports are linked to the same asset.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## What happens next

1. Your files are uploaded and a Ghost Flight Report job starts
2. Processing takes 5-10 minutes depending on file size
3. When complete, you get a link to your report and the page for that asset
