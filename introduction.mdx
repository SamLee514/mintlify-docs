## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- A terminal or command prompt open
- An **Atlas account** (Reach out in **#ext-arena-regent-craft** to get set up.)

<Note>
  This guide covers the terminal CLI. Atlas is also available on the [web](https://regent.atlas.arena-ai.com) for viewing reports.
</Note>

## Step 1: Install Atlas CLI

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://regent.atlas.arena-ai.com/api/v1/cli/install.sh | bash
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc
```

---

## Step 2: Authenticate

Link your Atlas account to the CLI:

```bash
atlas login
```

This opens a browser window to complete authentication. Once finished, your token is saved locally.

## Generating diagnostic issue reports

The `generate-issue` command provides an **interactive experience** to create AI-powered diagnostic reports from your data files. Atlas analyzes telemetry data, identifies root causes, and generates structured issue reports with evidence and visualizations.

```bash
atlas generate-issue
```

The CLI guides you through selecting files, adding context, and configuring your analysis. Files can be local paths, directories, or previously uploaded files.

---

## What happens next

1. Files are uploaded to Atlas (if needed).
2. A diagnostic job starts processing your data, and a link to the live job run is provided.
3. You'll see real-time progress as the job runs.
4. Processing takes 15-40 minutes depending on the size of your data upload (10GB of data ~ 30 minutes).
5. When complete, you'll receive a link to your diagnostic issue report.
