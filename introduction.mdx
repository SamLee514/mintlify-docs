## Get started in 30 seconds

**Prerequisites:**

An **Atlas account** (contact Arya Hezarkhini from Arena in **#sp-arena-ghost** to get set up)

---

## Install Atlas CLI

To install Atlas CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL http://ghost.anduril.gov.arena-ai.com/api/v1/cli/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, activate it in your current terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

```bash bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## Authenticate

Next, link your Atlas account to the CLI:

```bash
atlas login
```

This prompts you to open the login page and generates an authentication token. Once you finish logging in, enter the authentication token and navigate back to your terminal.

## Upload flight data

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single flight">
    ```bash
    atlas upload flight.bin --tailnum 4308
    ```
    
    The `--tailnum` is required to identify the asset when uploading flight logs.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Single flight with logs">
    ```bash
    atlas upload flight.bin -l software.log -l can.log --tailnum 4308
    ```
    
    Use the `-l` flag to attach log files for additional software and CAN bus analysis.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Multiple flights">
    ```bash
    atlas upload flight1.bin flight2.bin flight3.bin --tailnum 4308
    ```
    
    Multiple bin files are processed in parallel. All reports are linked to the same asset.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## What happens next

1. Your files are uploaded and a Ghost Flight Report job starts
2. Processing takes 5-10 minutes depending on file size and log analysis
3. When complete, you get a link to your report and the page for that asset
