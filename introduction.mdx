## Before you begin

Learn about Atlas CLI, Arena's command line tool for generating issues from your data - helping you turn raw telemetry into actionable insights faster than ever before.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- A terminal or command prompt open
- An **Atlas account** (Reach out in **#ext-arena-regent-craft** to get set up)

> **Note:** This guide covers the terminal CLI. Atlas is also available on the [web](https://regent.atlas.arena-ai.com) for viewing reports.

---

## Step 1: Install Atlas CLI

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://regent.atlas.arena-ai.com/api/v1/cli/install.sh | bash
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc
```

---

## Step 2: Authenticate

Link your Atlas account to the CLI:

```bash
atlas login
```

This opens a browser window to complete authentication. Once finished, your token is saved locally at `~/.atlas/token`.

## Generating diagnostic issue reports

The `generate-issue` command provides an **interactive experience** to create AI-powered diagnostic reports from your data files. Atlas analyzes telemetry data, identifies root causes, and generates structured issue reports with evidence and visualizations.

### Generating issues 

Run the command to start:

```bash
atlas generate-issue
```

The CLI will guide you through:

1. **File selection**: Provide a file or directory name (either a local path or something you've uploaded already)
   - Local files: `~/data/flight_data.parquet` or `data.parquet`
   - Directories: `~/telemetry/mission_1/` (uploads all files inside)
   - Uploaded files: Just the file or directory name if already uploaded

2. **Conflict handling**: If the file or directory has been uploaded to Atlas already, choose:
   - Use the existing uploaded file
   - Replace with your local version
   - Quit and rename

3. **Optional context**: Add up to 3 existing issue IDs to provide context (you can get the issue ID of an issue from the URL in the web app, i.e. `https://regent.atlas.arena-ai.com/issue/{issue ID}`)

4. **Additional instructions**: Provide any specific guidance for the analysis

5. **Confirmation**: Review your configuration before submitting

### What happens next

1. Files are uploaded to Atlas (if needed)
2. A diagnostic job starts processing your data
3. You'll see real-time progress:
   - `[Workflow] Thinking` - AI is analyzing the data
   - `[Tool] Using <tool>` - Atlas is querying telemetry, checking schemas, etc.
4. Processing takes 5-15 minutes depending on data size
5. When complete, you get a link to your diagnostic issue report

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single flight">
    ```bash
    atlas upload flight.bin --tailnum 4308
    ```

    The `--tailnum` is required to identify the asset when uploading flight data.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Multiple flights">
    ```bash
    atlas upload flight1.bin flight2.bin flight3.bin --tailnum 4308
    ```

    Multiple bin files are processed in parallel. All reports are linked to the same asset.
  </Tab>

## Resume interrupted jobs

If your terminal gets disconnected, you can re-attach to running jobs:

```bash
atlas generate-issue --resume
```

This shows a list of active jobs you can select and continue monitoring.

---

## Managing jobs

### Check job status

```bash
atlas status <job-run-id>
```

View the current status of any job run.

### Cancel a running job

```bash
atlas cancel <job-run-id>
```

Stop a job that's currently running or pending. The computation will stop and the job status will update to `cancelled`.

## Tips & best practices

**File uploads:**
- If you're analyzing the same data multiple times, the CLI remembers uploaded files - just select "use existing" when prompted
- For large directories, the CLI uploads files in parallel for faster processing
- Directory structure is preserved: `~/myFolder` uploads to `s3://bucket/user_uploaded_issue_files/myFolder`

**Job management:**
- The job run URL is displayed immediately when a job starts - save it for reference
- Use `--resume` if you need to disconnect from the CLI but want to check back later
- Jobs can be viewed and managed on the web at `https://regent.atlas.arena-ai.com/jobs/<job-run-id>`

**Authentication:**
- Your token is saved to `~/.atlas/token` and remains valid for 24 hours
- Run `atlas login` again if you see authentication errors
- The Atlas URL is saved to `~/.atlas/url` during installation

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Not authenticated" error:**
```bash
atlas login
```

**SSL certificate errors during install:**
```bash
curl -fsSL -k https://regent.atlas.arena-ai.com/api/v1/cli/install.sh | bash
```

**Can't find uploaded file:**
- Check the filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Use the full path if the file is in a subdirectory
- Files are uploaded to `user_uploaded_issue_files/` prefix in S3

**Job taking too long:**
- Check the job status on the web: `https://regent.atlas.arena-ai.com/jobs/<job-run-id>`
- Large datasets with many files can take 15+ minutes
- You can safely disconnect and use `--resume` to check back later
