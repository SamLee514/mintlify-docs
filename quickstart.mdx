# Quick Start

Let's get your first Ghost Flight Report generated. This takes about 2 minutes.

---

## Step 1: Configure Your Server

First, tell the CLI where your Atlas deployment lives:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.atlas
echo 'https://your-atlas-server/api/v1' > ~/.atlas/url
```

<Info>
  Replace `your-atlas-server` with your actual Atlas deployment hostname.
</Info>

---

## Step 2: Authenticate

Run the login command:

```bash
atlas login
```

This will:
1. Generate a one-time code
2. Copy it to your clipboard
3. Open your browser to the authentication page

```
  ◐ Requesting device code...
  ✓ Device code received

  To authenticate, visit:

    https://your-atlas-server/auth/device

  And enter code:

    ABCD-1234

  Code copied to clipboard

  ◐ Waiting for authorization...
```

Enter the code in your browser, and you're authenticated. Your token is saved to `~/.atlas/token`.

---

## Step 3: Upload a Flight

Now the fun part. Upload a `.bin` file:

```bash
atlas upload flight.bin --tailnum 436
```

Watch the magic happen:

## Add Log Files for Deeper Analysis

Want software and CAN bus analysis? Add log files:

```bash
atlas upload flight.bin -l heliod.log -l can.log --tailnum 436
```

The `-l` flag can be repeated for multiple log files. Atlas will correlate the logs with your telemetry for comprehensive analysis.
