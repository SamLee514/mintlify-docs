## Authentication Issues

### "Not authenticated" Error

✗ Not authenticated. Run 'atlas login' or set ATLAS_TOKEN
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Solution">
    Run `atlas login` to authenticate via browser, or set the `ATLAS_TOKEN` environment variable:
    
    ```bash
    export ATLAS_TOKEN="your-api-token"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### "No Atlas URL configured" Error

```
✗ No Atlas URL configured.
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Solution">
    Create the URL config file:

    mkdir -p ~/.atlas
    echo 'https://your-atlas-server/api/v1' > ~/.atlas/url
    ```

## Upload Issues

### "File not found" Error

```
✗ File not found: flight.bin
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Solution">
    Check that the file path is correct. Use absolute paths if needed:
    
    ```bash
    atlas upload /full/path/to/flight.bin --tailnum 436
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### "Missing required flag: --tailnum" Error

```
✗ Missing required flag: --tailnum

  Example: atlas upload flight.bin --tailnum 436
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Solution">
    The `--tailnum` flag is required. Add it to your command:
    
    ```bash
    atlas upload flight.bin --tailnum 436
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Upload Timeout

```
✗ Timeout after 15m 0s
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Solution">
    Large files or slow connections may exceed the default timeout. Check your network connection and try again.
    
    For very large files, ensure you have a stable connection. The CLI has a 5-minute timeout for individual HTTP requests.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Job Failed

```
✗ Job failed after 3m 22s
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Solution">
    Check the Atlas web interface for detailed error logs. Common causes:
    
    - Corrupted bin file
    - Unsupported file format
    - Server-side processing error
    
    Try re-uploading. If the issue persists, contact support with the job run ID.
  </Accordion>

## TLS/Certificate Issues

### Certificate Verification Error

```
x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Solution">
    **For local development only**, use the `-k` flag to skip certificate verification:
    
    ```bash
    atlas -k upload flight.bin --tailnum 436
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      Never use `-k` in production. It disables TLS security.
    </Warning>
    
    **For production**, ensure your system trusts the server's certificate. You may need to install CA certificates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## PATH Issues

### "Command not found: atlas"

```
bash: atlas: command not found
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Solution">
    The CLI is installed to `~/.local/bin/`. Add it to your PATH:
    
    ```bash
    export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"
    ```
    
    Add this line to your shell config (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) to make it permanent.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
