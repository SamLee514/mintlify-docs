# Parallel Uploads

Got a stack of flight data to process? The Atlas CLI handles multiple flights in parallel, giving you real-time progress on each one.

---

## How It Works

When you pass multiple `.bin` files, the CLI:

1. **Resolves the asset once** - All files share the same tail number
2. **Launches parallel workers** - Each file processes independently  
3. **Shows live progress** - Real-time status for every flight
4. **Aggregates results** - Summary with links to all reports

---

## Usage

Just pass multiple bin files:

```bash
atlas upload flight1.bin flight2.bin flight3.bin flight4.bin --tailnum 436
```

---

## Live Progress Display

The CLI shows a real-time dashboard:

```
  ⬡ Parallel Upload
    Processing 4 flights simultaneously

  ◐ Checking asset...
  ✓ Asset found

  ⠋ flight1.bin (1m 12s)
  ⠙ flight2.bin (1m 08s)
  ✓ flight3.bin (2m 45s) → https://atlas.../issue/abc123
  ⠹ flight4.bin (0m 55s)
```

As each flight completes, it updates in place with the report URL.

---

## Final Summary

When all flights finish:

```
  ✓ flight1.bin (3m 22s) → https://atlas.../issue/def456
  ✓ flight2.bin (3m 18s) → https://atlas.../issue/ghi789
  ✓ flight3.bin (2m 45s) → https://atlas.../issue/abc123
  ✓ flight4.bin (3m 01s) → https://atlas.../issue/jkl012

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  ✓ All 4 flights completed

    Asset: https://atlas.../fleet/xyz789
```

All reports are automatically linked to the same fleet asset.

## Performance

| Flights | Sequential Time | Parallel Time | Speedup |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| 2 | ~6 min | ~3 min | 2x |
| 4 | ~12 min | ~3.5 min | 3.5x |
| 8 | ~24 min | ~4 min | 6x |

<Info>
  Parallel processing is limited by server capacity, not the CLI. Most deployments handle 4-8 concurrent uploads efficiently.
</Info>

## Handling Failures

If some flights fail, you'll see a mixed summary:

```
  ✓ flight1.bin (3m 22s) → https://atlas.../issue/def456
  ✗ flight2.bin - job failed
  ✓ flight3.bin (2m 45s) → https://atlas.../issue/abc123
  ✓ flight4.bin (3m 01s) → https://atlas.../issue/jkl012

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  ! 3 succeeded, 1 failed

    Asset: https://atlas.../fleet/xyz789
```

<Tip>
  Re-run just the failed files. Successfully processed flights are already in Atlas.
</Tip>

## Limitations

<Warning>
  **Log files are not supported in parallel mode.**
  
  When using `-l` to attach log files, you must upload a single bin file:
  
  ```bash
  # This works
  atlas upload flight.bin -l software.log --tailnum 436
  
  # This does NOT work
  atlas upload flight1.bin flight2.bin -l software.log --tailnum 436
  ```
</Warning>

---

## Batch Processing Script

For large batches, use a simple loop:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Process all bin files in a directory

for file in /path/to/flights/*.bin; do
  atlas upload "$file" --tailnum 436
done
```

Or process in parallel batches:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Process in batches of 4

files=(/path/to/flights/*.bin)
batch_size=4

for ((i=0; i<${#files[@]}; i+=batch_size)); do
  batch=("${files[@]:i:batch_size}")
  atlas upload "${batch[@]}" --tailnum 436
done
```
