## atlas login

Authenticate with Atlas using device code flow.

```bash
atlas login
```

Opens a browser to complete authentication. Your token is saved to `~/.atlas/token` for future use.

---

## atlas logout

Remove saved authentication credentials.

```bash
atlas logout
```

---

## atlas generate-issue

Generate AI-powered diagnostic issue reports from your data files.

```bash
atlas generate-issue [options]
```

### Interactive flow

The command provides an interactive experience that guides you through:

1. **File selection**: Provide a file or directory name (either a local path or something you've uploaded already).
   - Local files: `~/data/flight_data.parquet` or `data.parquet`
   - Directories: `~/telemetry/mission_1/` (uploads all files inside)
   - Uploaded files: Just the file or directory name if already uploaded.

2. **Conflict handling**: If the file or directory has been uploaded to Atlas already, choose:
   - Use the existing uploaded file
   - Replace with your local version
   - Quit and rename

3. **Optional context**: Add up to 3 existing issue IDs to provide context (you can get the issue ID from the URL in the web app, e.g., `https://regent.atlas.arena-ai.com/issue/{issue ID}`).

4. **Additional instructions**: Provide any specific guidance for the analysis.

5. **Confirmation**: Review your configuration before submitting.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--resume` | Resume monitoring an existing job run |

### Examples

```bash
# Start new issue generation
atlas generate-issue

# Resume monitoring a previous job
atlas generate-issue --resume
```

### Resume interrupted jobs

If your terminal gets disconnected, you can re-attach to running jobs:

```bash
atlas generate-issue --resume
```

This shows a list of active jobs you can select and continue monitoring.

---

## atlas status

Check the status of an existing job run.

```bash
atlas status <job-run-id>
```

The job run ID is displayed when you start issue generation. You can also find it in the URL when viewing a job on the web.

### Status values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Job is queued |
| `running` | Job is processing |
| `completed` | Job finished successfully |
| `failed` | Job encountered an error |
| `cancelled` | Job was cancelled |

### Examples

```bash
atlas status 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

---

## atlas cancel

Cancel a running or pending job.

```bash
atlas cancel <job-run-id>
```

Stop a job that's currently running or pending. The computation stops and the job status updates to `cancelled`.

### Examples

```bash
atlas cancel 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

---

## atlas version

Display the CLI version.

```bash
atlas version
```

---

## Tips & best practices

### File uploads

- If you're analyzing the same data multiple times, the CLI remembers previously uploaded files - just select "use existing" when prompted.
- For large directories, the CLI uploads files in parallel for faster processing.
- Directory structure is preserved: `~/myFolder` uploads to `s3://bucket/user_uploaded_issue_files/myFolder`.

### Job management

- The job run URL is displayed immediately when a job starts - save it for reference.
- Use `--resume` if you need to disconnect from the CLI but want to check back later.
- Jobs can be viewed and managed on the web at `https://regent.atlas.arena-ai.com/jobs/<job-run-id>`.

### Authentication

- Your token is saved to `~/.atlas/token` and remains valid for 24 hours.
- Run `atlas login` again if you see authentication errors.
- The Atlas URL is saved to `~/.atlas/url` during installation.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Not authenticated" error

```bash
atlas login
```

Run this command to re-authenticate with Atlas.

---

### Can't find uploaded file

- Check that the filename matches exactly (case-sensitive).
- Use the full path if the file is in a subdirectory.
- Files are uploaded to the `user_uploaded_issue_files/` prefix in S3.

---

### Job taking too long

- Check the job status on the web: `https://regent.atlas.arena-ai.com/jobs/<job-run-id>`.
- Large datasets with many files can take 15 minutes or more.
- You can safely disconnect and use `--resume` to check back later.
